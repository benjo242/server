Bio:

Self proclaimed God and Hacker. Doesn’t play well with others, his whole aim and enjoyment is to create chaos, fear and torture, his hacking is average but where he really shines is in his manipulation tactics, he usually focuses on one person in a group, putting pressure on that person, framing them and isolating them from the group, before expanding and breaking apart a team from the inside. His master plan is to expose every single RLSH member out to the public, and become seen as a God in the process.
